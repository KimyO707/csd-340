    <p class="intro">
        Hello! My name is Kimberly, and I am currently studying at Bellevue University. 
        I have always been interested in technology and web development, which is why I am excited about this course.
        Learning HTML and CSS will help me build the foundation I need to create websites.
    </p>

    <p>
        I grew up in Tecumseh NE, and it has always been a special place for me. 
        Everyone in this town is very <span id="word1">_________</span> to each other, and I have many great memories from my childhood. 
        <span class="sentence">One of my favorite things to do is play <span id="word2">_________</span> and spend time with my family</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        When I am not studying, I enjoy several hobbies, including reading fantasy novels and playing games. 
        My family is very <span id="word3">_________</span> and has always pushed me to follow my dreams. 
        I hope to one day create a project that combines my love for <span id="word4">_________</span> and technology.
    </p>
