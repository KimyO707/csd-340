        <p class="intro">
            Hello! My name is Kimberly, and I am currently studying at Bellevue University. 
            I have always been interested in technology and web development, which is why I am excited about this course.
            Learning HTML and CSS will help me build the foundation I need to create websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            I grew up in Tecumseh NE, and it has always been a special place for me. 
            Everyone in this town are very close to eachother, and I have many great memories from my childhood. 
            <span class="sentence">One of my favorite things to do is play videogames and spend time with my family</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            When I am not studying, I enjoy several hobbies, including reading fantasy novels and playing video games. 
            Video games have inspired me to learn more about software development and game design. 
            I hope to one day create a project that combines my love for storytelling and technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            My family has always been a great support system for me, encouraging me to pursue my goals. 
            They have taught me the importance of hard work. I will always be thankful for their support. 
            I am looking forward to learning more in this class and improving my web development skills.
        </p>
